# Phishing_Detector-Minor_Project

PhishDetect is a fullstack minor project: a web application that helps detect potentially malicious/phishing links and emails, and teaches users about phishing attacks, mitigation techniques, and how to report suspicious messages.
Built as an educational tool and defensive aid — not a production-grade security product.

🚩 Quick summary
* Purpose: Analyze URLs and email text for phishing indicators, provide explanations, and offer learning resources + reporting guidance.
* Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend) • Python scripts & Flask API (backend).
* Intended use: Education, lab testing, and defensive awareness. Only run against data/systems you own or have permission to test.

🔍 Features
* URL and email content submission form for phishing analysis
* Backend detection endpoint that runs heuristic checks (and optional ML scoring)
* Explanations of why an item is flagged (indicators: suspicious domain, IP usage, obfuscation, spoofing, urgent language, suspicious attachments/links)
* Learning resources: phishing types, common tactics, mitigation best-practices, and reporting steps
* Simple reporting flow that creates a local report (or prepares data for third-party reporting)
* Lightweight, extendable Flask API for integration and experimentation
